# Dereferencing a NULL Pointer, without a Seg Fault?


> We've all heard that Chuck Norris can count to infinity, twice. We've all heard that Chuck Norris can drown a fish. Chuck Norris can divide by 0. And we all remember the time when Chuck Norris hit a 475- foot home run into upper deck Yankee Stadium, while bunting.

> But have you ever heard anything about Chuck Norris dereferencing a NULL pointer? Well, not really. But that's because it's really not that hard to do.

Weird stuff man, blew my mind! Completely unexpected. I made this a github repo purely because of it's awesomeness.  
Here's a link back to the blog I found this on.

#### Also
>Chuck Norris hit a 475- foot home run

or
>Chuck Norris hit a 475+ foot home run

I'm thinking the latter.

**Update**:
>Chuck Norris once hit a 475-foot home run into the upper deck at Yankee Stadium. He was bunting.
